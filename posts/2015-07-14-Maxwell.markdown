Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 

* Complex polynomials(complex coefficients) can be factored in to n factors with n roots that may not be distinct.
* Since reals are subset of complex, implies typical real polynomials can always be factored resulting in real or complex roots.
* Complex numbers have a closure property in factoring
