title: Why Hakyll

It's minimalistic.
It's fast.
Plus it's a good excuse to find a more applied use for Haskell.

I had thought about using Gatsby but decided I would rather make a separate page that is more dynamic and project focused.

```bash
chcp 65001
stack exec myblog clean
stack exec myblog build
```
$$ x \in $$

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "some message"
git push origin main:main
```



``` haskell
fac n = foldr (*) 1 [1..n]
```

```{.ruby .numberLines}
def greet; "Hello, world!"; end
```
\\[ \\ln x = \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac 1 y \\, dy . \\]
