```hs
Sequencing :: gene -> expression
Expression
```

```hs

Microarray :: (Vivo x) => Known-genes x -> expression-levels x
RNA-Seq :: (Vivo x) => RNA x -> expression-levels x
Known-genes âŠ† RNA
--(Vivo x) => .. is a type class 
```

RNA-Sequencing is expensive compared to microarrays

RNA-Seq 

* RNA-Seq 
  1. Make cDNA library from RNA
  2. Chop up the pieces


# Crossing

```hs
type Chromosome x = x :: (Chromosome x) | Nil
-- ex. 
type Genome a b = (Chromosome a, Chromosome b)  

crossing :: Genome a b -> Genome a b -> Genome a b
crossing [Cha_Gal4, Cha_L13] []
```

* Phenotypical markers vs Genotypical markers



# FLP-FRT recombination


```hs
Insertion = plasmid[..Frt,i,Frt..] + [a,Frt,b] -> [a,Frt,i,Frt,b] 
Deletion = [a,Frt,i,Frt,b] -> [a,Frt,b]
Inversion = [a,Frt,Seq,Frt,b] -> [a,Frt,rev(Seq),Frt,b]
Transitivity = [a,Frt,x] -> [y,Frt,b] -> [a,Frt,b] 
```
