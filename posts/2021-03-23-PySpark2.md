## RDD 

multiple small methods that process and analyze country, city and location data.

Sample data of "allCountries.txt" data from http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/allCountries.zip. You can test your functions in the cell below them. The variable `testFile` contains the data.

Read https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html for a guide

sc = SparkContext("local","GeoProcessor")
testFile = sc.textFile("allCountries_sample.txt")
```

## Extract Data
`extractData` removes unnecessary fields and splits the data so that the RDD looks like  RDD(Array("name","countryCode","dem"),...)).

Fields to include:  
* name  
* counryCode  
* dem (digital elevation model)  


param `data`: data set loaded into spark as RDD[String]  

`return`: RDD containing filtered location data. There should be an Array for each location.


Hint: you can first split each line into an array. Columns are separated by tab ("\t") character. Finally you should take the appropriate fields. The fields will be numbered by the location they are ordered in the original data scheme. Despite the method's name, you might only need the `map` function.





```python
def extractData(data):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    spitline = data.map(lambda x: x.split("\t"))
    select = spitline.map(lambda x: [x[1],x[8],x[16]])
    return select
    #raise NotImplementedError()
```


```python
#Example print

extractData(testFile).take(5)
```




    [['Tosa de la Llosada', 'AD', '2475'],
     ['Riu de la Llosada', 'AD', '1900'],
     ['Obaga de la Llosada', 'AD', '2300'],
     ['Emprius de la Llosada', 'AD', '2299'],
     ['Basers de la Llosada', 'AD', '2321']]




```python
'''extractData tests'''
filtered = extractData(testFile)
testObject = filtered.collect()[1]
assert testObject[0] == "Riu de la Llosada", "the name value of the object was expected to be 'Riu de la Llosada' but it was %s" % testObject[0]
assert testObject[1] == "AD", "the country code value of the object was expected to be 'AD' but it was %s" % testObject[1]
assert testObject[2] == "1900", "the dem value of the object was expected to be 1900 but it was %s" % testObject[2]
assert len(testObject) == 3, "the length of the array was expected to be 3 but it was %s" % len(testObject)
assert type(testObject) is list, "the type of the RDD element was expected to be list but it was %s" % type(testObject)
```

## Filter Elevation

`filterElevation` is used to filter to given countryCode and return RDD containing only dem information. You will have to convert the dem information to `int` values.

param `countryCode`: country code e.g "AD"  
param `data`: an RDD containing multiple Array["name", "countryCode", "dem"] (as in it was returned by the `extractData` function)   

`return`: RDD[int] containing only dem information  



```python
def filterElevation(countryCode, data):
    
    filt = data.filter(lambda x: x[1]==countryCode)
    convert = filt.map(lambda x: int(x[2]))
    
    
    return convert
    #raise NotImplementedError()
```


```python
#Example print
filterElevation("AD", extractData(testFile)).take(5)
#filterElevation("AD", extractData(testFile)).take(5)
```




    [2475, 1900, 2300, 2299, 2321]




```python
'''filterElevation tests'''
filtered = extractData(testFile)
first = filterElevation("SE", filtered).first()
assert type(first) is int, "the type of the RDD element was expected to be int but it was %s" % type(first)
assert first == 56, "the value of the RDD element was expected to be 56 but it was %s" % first
object = filterElevation("AD", filtered).collect()[4]
assert object == 2321, "the value of the RDD element was expected to be 2321 but it was %s" % object
```

## Elevation Average

`elevationAverage` calculates the dem average to specific dataset.  

param `data`: RDD[int] containing only dem information  

`return`: The average elevation  



```python
def elevationAverage(data):
    summ = data.reduce(lambda a,b: a + b)
    countr = data.count()
    avg = summ/countr
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    return avg
    #raise NotImplementedError()
```


```python
#Example print

elevationAverage(sc.parallelize(filterElevation("AD", extractData(testFile)).take(5)))
```




    2259.0




```python
'''elevationAverage tests'''
avg = elevationAverage(sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3 ,4])) 
assert avg == 2.5, "the average was expected to be 2.5 but it was %s" % avg
filtered = extractData(testFile)
elevations = filterElevation("AD", filtered)
avg2 = elevationAverage(elevations)
assert avg2 == 1792.25, "the average was expected to be 1792.25 but it was %s" % avg2
assert type(avg2) is float, "the type of the RDD element was expected to be float but it was %s" % type(avg2)
```

## Most Common Words

`mostCommonWords` calculates what is the most common  word in place names and returns an RDD[(String,Int)]. You can assume that words are separated by a single space ' '.

param `data`: an RDD containing multiple Array["name", "countryCode", "dem"].  

`return`: RDD[(String,Int)] where string is the word and Int number of occurances. RDD should be in descending order (sorted by number of occurances). e.g ("hotel", 234), ("airport", 120), ("new", 12). 

Example:  
Assume that the place name is "Andorra la Vella Heliport". We split the name so that we have 4 seperate words "Andorra", "la", "Vella" and "Heliport".



```python

def mostCommonWords(data):
    wordlist = data.map(lambda x:x[0].split(" "))
    #countwrd = wordlist.reduce(lambda acc, n: )
    pairlist = wordlist.map(lambda x: [(i,1) for i in x] )
    summ = pairlist.reduce(lambda a,b: a + b)
    inter = sc.parallelize(summ)
    tot = inter.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a + b)
    rev = tot.map(lambda x: (x[1],x[0]))
    final = rev.sortByKey(False)
    rev2 = final.map(lambda x: (x[1],x[0]))
    return rev2
```


```python
#Example print

mostCommonWords(extractData(testFile)).take(5)
#mostCommonWords(extractData(testFile))[:10]
#mostCommonWords(extractData(testFile))

```




    [('Hotel', 22), ('de', 15), ('la', 12), ('Hotell', 7), ('dels', 6)]




```python
'''mostCommonWords tests'''
filtered = extractData(testFile)
words = mostCommonWords(filtered).collect()
first = words[0]
second = words[1]
third = words[2]
assert type(first[0]) is str, "the type of the first value in array was expected to be str but it was %s" % type(first[0])
assert type(first[1]) is int, "the type of the second value in array was expected to be int but it was %s" % type(first[1])
assert first[1] >= second[1], "the first element in RDD was expected to have more occurances than the second"
assert first[0] == "Hotel", "the first element was expected to be named Hotel but it was %s" % first[0]
assert first[1] == 22, "the count of the first element was expected to be 22 but it was %s" % first[1]
assert third[0] == "la", "the third element was expected to be named 'la' but it was %s" % third[0]
```

## Most Common Country

`mostCommonCountry` tells which country has the most entries in geolocation data. The correct name for specific countrycode can be found from countrycodes.csv. The columns in countrycodes.csv are seperated by ",". More specifially, the file is structured like this:

Fiji,FJ  
Finland,FI  
France,FR  

param `data`: an RDD containing multiple Array["name", "countryCode", "dem"].  
param `codeData`: data from countrycodes.csv file  

`return`: most common country as String e.g Finland or empty string "" if countrycodes.csv doesn't have that entry.



```python
countryCodes = sc.textFile("countrycodes.csv")

def mostCommonCountry(data, codeData):
    cunt = data.map(lambda x: (x[1],1))
    summ = cunt.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a + b)
    iterm = codeData.map(lambda x: x.split(","))
    revind = iterm.map(lambda x: (x[1],x[0]))
    out = revind.join(summ).collect()
    a1 = sc.parallelize(out)
    a2 = a1.map(lambda x: (x[1][1],x[1][0]))
    if a2.isEmpty():
        return ""
    a3 = a2.sortByKey(False)
    
    return a3.first()[1]
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #raise NotImplementedError()
```


```python
#Example print
mostCommonCountry(extractData(testFile), countryCodes)
#mostCommonCountry(extractData(testFile), countryCodes)[:5]
#mostCommonCountry(extractData(testFile), countryCodes)[0].take(5)
#mostCommonCountry(extractData(testFile), countryCodes)[1].take(5)
```




    'Sweden'




```python
'''mostCommonCountry tests'''
filtered = extractData(testFile)
mostCommon = mostCommonCountry(filtered, countryCodes)
assert type(mostCommon) is str, "the type of the returned object was expected to be str but it was %s" % type(mostCommon)
assert mostCommon == "Sweden", "the most common was expected to be Sweden but it was %s" % mostCommon
mostCommon2 = mostCommonCountry(sc.parallelize(filtered.take(40)), countryCodes)
assert mostCommon2 == "Andorra", "the most common was expected to be Andorra but it was %s" % mostCommon2
false = sc.parallelize([["a", "AA", 123], ["b", "AA", 1234]])
assert mostCommonCountry(false, countryCodes) == "", "The method was expected to return empty when called with false data"
```

## Hotels In Area

`hotelsInArea` determines how many hotels there are within 10 km (<=10000.0) from given latitude and longitude.
Use Haversine formula ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula ). Earth radius is 6371000 meters. 

Don't use the feature code field. You should start by reading the data and getting the correct fields (name, latitude, longitude) similarly to the `extractData` function. After that you should use the Haversine formula to filter the places in 10 Km radius from the latitude and longitude. You will probably want to use a helper function, Python lets you create functions inside functions. Finally, you will want to filter the places that contain the word "hotel". Location is a hotel if the name contains the word "hotel" (can be "Hotel" or "hOtel" for instance). There can exist multiple hotels in the same location. 

Note that both latitude and longitude in the data are in decimal degree so you have to change them to radians ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees ). They should also be converted to double values. E.g `math.radians(float(x))`

param `lat`: latitude as Double  
param `long`: longitude as Double  
param `data`: the original data set loaded into spark as RDD[String].  

`return`: number of hotels in area



```python
import math
testFile = sc.textFile("testdata.txt")
  
def hotelsInArea(lat, long, data):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    def haversine(lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2):
        rlat1 = math.radians(float(lat1))
        rlat2 = math.radians(float(lat2))
        rlon1 = math.radians(float(lon1))
        rlon2 = math.radians(float(lon2))
        radius = 6371000
        vara1 = (rlat2 - rlat1)/2
        varb1 = (rlon2 - rlon1)/2
        varc1 = math.cos(rlat1) #
        vard1 = math.cos(rlat2) #
        vara2 = math.sin(vara1)
        vara3 = vara2**2
        varb2 = math.sin(varb1)
        varb3 = varb2**2
        pre1 = (vara3 + (varc1*vard1*varb3))**(1/2)
        pre2 = 2 * radius *math.asin(pre1)
        return pre2
    boundary = 10000  
    distfun = lambda a,b: haversine(lat,long,a,b)
    formatt = data.map(lambda x: x.split("\t"))
    formatt2 = formatt.map(lambda x: [x[2],float(x[4]),float(x[5])])
    f3 = formatt2.filter(lambda x: distfun(x[1],x[2]) <= boundary and "hotel" in x[0].lower())
    f4 = f3.map(lambda x: ((x[1],x[2]),1))
    f5 = f4.reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a + b) 
    return f5.count()
    #data.map(lambda x: x.split())
    #raise NotImplementedError()
```
