# Economic Indictators

## Inflation and Bonds

Fixed-income investors aka Bond traders REALLY WATCH Inflation

[GDP price deflator from BEA to check inflation](https://www.bea.gov/data/prices-inflation/gdp-price-deflator)  

[CPI](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm)
In the US, food only makes up 15% CPI, and Housing makes 40% CPI

## Unemployment

non-farm payrolls (this disregards seasonal farm workers) and is the most useful measure of unemployment

It correlates with GDP (recessions)

## Big Corp Confidence = PMI

**PMI IS THE BEST ECONOMIC INDICATOR SINCE IT PREDICTS GDP**
