# Open Delta neighborhoods

Neighborhood is a set N.

$$N(x_0,\delta) = \{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\ |\ \lvert x-x_0 \rvert < \delta \}$$

* 1-D neigborhood : Interval
* 2-D neighborhood: points in circle
* 3-D neighborhood: points in ball

# Interior Point - Ball inside Ball 




`Metric_Space := (M,dist) :: (Set,binary_operation)`{.haskell}


Fields of knowledge as Metric Spaces (M,d)

* Metric Space of Proofs in Math  
$(M,d) := (math,dist_{math})$
* Metric Space of Reactions in Chemistry  
$(M,d) := (chem,dist_{chem})$

Mapping metric spaces of knowledge AKA analogies  

* Analogies as a mapping between Metric Spaces of Knowledge
  * "Reagents is-to Reaction" as "Antecedents is-to Theorem"
  * $dist_{chem}(reagents,reaction) \approx dist_{math}(antecedents,theorem)$

    

# Limit aka Limit point

* Given Metric Space $(M,d)$
* $S \subseteq M$
* p is a limit of S iff $\exists p_n :: sequence$ s.t. $p_n converges to p$


# Open Set

Let A = (0,0)
OpenSet((1,2)) = {(x,y) | (x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 < r^2 }
Boundary((1,2)) = {(x,y) | (x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = r^2}
ClosedSet((1,2)) = OpenSet((1,2)) + Boundary((1,2))


# Topological Spaces

Topology(X) = subsets of X s.t.  
if a, b are subsets in the topology(X) then a UNION b in topology(X) and a INTERSECT b in topology(X).
Nullset and set X are in the topology(X) by default.
