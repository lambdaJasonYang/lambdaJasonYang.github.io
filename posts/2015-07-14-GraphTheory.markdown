### Cuts

* Cut : a partition of the NODES of a graph, NOT the edges.
* Cut-Set: The boundary edges that connects these two cuts or partitions. 
  * Elements of the cut-set are edges that exist in both Cuts bridging one cut to the other cut.

Obviously to Span a tree, one must choose at least 1 edge of a Cut-Set 

The minimum element in a Cut-Set is the edge contained in all MST.
