title: Type Theory and Predicting the Far Future
tags: musings

Behind all the hype with Machine learning, GPT-3, OpenAI, there is another contender that will set the stage for future developers.
Type Theory.

In the future, we can "simply" design code that carries a proof of correctness using types and the compiler will automagically swap out our inefficient code with the most optimized version. I say "simply" tongue in cheek because these proofs are actually really bulky in comparison to traditional mathematical proofs.

Perhaps in a decade, they may find a solution that combines the Cloud, AI and Type theory to bring hyper-optimized compilers to every programmers workdesk.
