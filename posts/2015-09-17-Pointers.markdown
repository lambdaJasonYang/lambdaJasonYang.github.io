$$ Address \rightarrow Value $$
$$ Pointer \rightarrow Address \rightarrow Value $$

* pass-by-pointer vs pass-by-ref
  * pass-by-pointer when you need a NULL placeholder.
* the way to use pass-by-ref is similar to pass-by-value  
* pass-by-pointer requires passing an address

```C
//pass-by-pointer
int &x = ...;
void func(*p){
  p = x;
}

//pass-by-ref
int x = ...;
void func(&p){
  p = x;
}
```
