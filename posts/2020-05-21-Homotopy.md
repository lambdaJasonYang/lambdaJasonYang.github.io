# Type formation

$$ \cfrac{\vdash A: Type \qquad \vdash x,y: A}{\vdash x=_{A}y : Type} \tag{type formation}$$

* forming a type like $\vdash 0 = 1 : Type$ is not asserting that $0 = 1$ , it is more like it is asking whether $0 = 1$ which is only true if a term inhabits this type $0 = 1$
* $\vdash x = y : Type$ means there are many prove $x = y$ similarly a function from $Int -> Bool$ there are many functions that satisfy the typing.
  * A single path between $x$ and $y$ represents a single proof of equality.
  * The path between aka connect 2 paths aka the proof that connects two proof of equality is called a homotopy.


$$ cfrac{\vdash x: A}{\vdash refl_{x} : x=_{A}x} \tag{term intro}$$

$x,y: A , p : x =_{A} y \vdash B(x,y,p)$ , to produce a term of type B(x,y,p) it suffices to assume y is x and p is refl_{x}
