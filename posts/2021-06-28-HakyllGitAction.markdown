### Autogenerate static site on git push to github

Building a Hakyll site from source takes an hour the first time you do it.  
Once it is cached, it only takes a few seconds.  

But what if you wanted to update your blog post while away from your personal computer.  
If only we could just push the markdown file to github and have the project build itself.

And we can with github action!  
Simply make a ".github\\workflows" folder in your root hakyll directory and make a new *.yml file and copy the code below then place it in the workflows folder.

This github action will automatically find the name of your Hakyll project to build.   
It will also cache the workspace so the next build will a fraction of the time on github servers.

# UserJY - Github action to autobuild Hakyll static pages on push

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

        run: stack exec -- $autotarget clean
            
      - name: Building hakyll static pages
        run: stack exec -- $autotarget build

      - name: step 5
        run: |
             pwd
             ls

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: commit built site
        run: |
           git config user.name github-actions
           git config user.email github-actions@github.com
           git add .
           git commit -am "Autobuild Hakyll site github action commit"
           git push

```

Now you can update your blog anywhere, just  
1. pull your hakyll repo from github  
2. add your new markdown file to your posts folder  
3. push it to your hakyll repo **WITHOUT NEEDING TO SPEND 1 HOUR BUILDING IT BEFOREHAND**  

All this will take 2 minutes at most.
