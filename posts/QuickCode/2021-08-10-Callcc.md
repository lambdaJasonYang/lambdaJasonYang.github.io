```bash
   plusk
   / \   \
  2   5   k
 +----+   |
   |      |
plus(2,5) | 
   |      |
   o------o
    plus(2,5) is piped into k
```


```bash
def plusk(a,b,k):
  k(a+b)
def mulk(a,b,k):
  k(a*b)

plusk(2,5, λK.mulk(a,7,print))
```

```bash

      plusk
     / \   \
    2   5   λK.mulk
   +--&--+   /  \   \
      |     K    7  print
      |     |    |      |
plus(2,5)   |    |      |
      |     |    |      |
      o--#--o    |      |
         |       |      |
         |       |      |
  K:=plus(2,5)   |      |
         +----&--+      |
              |         |
      mul(plus(2,5),7)  |
              |         |
              o----#----o   

+--&--+ stands for unwrap, ex: unwrap plusk to plus
o--#--o stands for pipe, ex: pipe plus(2,5) into λK
```       


1. plusk is unwrapped to plus and @ to (2,5) RESULT: plus(2,5)
2. continuation of plusk, λK.mulk(a,7,print) is @ to plus(2,5) RESULT: mulk(7,7,print)
3. mulk is unwrapped to mul and @ to (7,7) RESULT: mul(7,7)
4. continuation of mulk, print is @ to mul(7,7)


The continuation k is applied @ to (2,5)

## Example 2

* Notice all the *action* is being done in the argument of the function.

```bash
def Negk(a,k):
  k(-a)

Negk(3,λa.Negk(a,λb.Negk(b,return)))

#same as above but formatted differently
Negk(3,
      λa.Negk(a,
                λb.Negk(b,return)
              )
    )
```

# Investigating callcc

* `((a ->b) -> a*) -> a`
* `cont :: (a ->b)` the power of having the continuation as a function or as the bound lambda variable is that we don't actually have to use the continuation.
  * `lambda cont. 3 :: (a -> b) -> Int` notice it doesnt matter what out `cont` is, we just return 3 regardless
* `a*` can be considered the hole to be filled. in  `2 + callcc...`, the hole of the `2 + []` is an Int.

```bash
   +
  / \
 2   @
    /  \
callcc  lambda cont.
         |
         @
        / \
      cont 3
```
```bash    
(+2 (callcc (lambda (cont) 3 )))
> 5
```

* in the above case we never used the continuation
* `(lambda (cont) 3 ) :: ? -> ?`
* `callcc :: (?-> ?) -> Int`
  * note that `(? -> ?)` can also be `((? -> ?) -> ?)`
* `(callcc (lambda (cont) 3 )) :: Int ` since we know this expr return 3 for the output to be 5


```
(+ 2 (callcc (lambda cont (cont 3) 6 )))
(+ 2 3)
```

* `callcc :: ((a -> b) -> a) -> a`
* `cont :: (Int -> b)`
* `cont 3 :: Int`
* `lambda cont (cont 3) :: (Int -> b) -> Int` 

# Continuation return beta

* `cont x :: b` 
  * this means we can apply any operation on `sq(cont x) :: Nat` `str(cont x) :: Bool` and the type can be anything but since continuation is like an early return, it doesn't do anything meaningful but change the type.

# The only type that really matters it the first a

* `callcc :: ((a ...`
  * The first `a` is basically the save point and it determines the third and forth `a`.
