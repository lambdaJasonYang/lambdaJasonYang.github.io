*  id ( PRIMARY KEY) of the table -- it identifies each row in the table and allows us to conveniently refer to any row.

# Basics

## Make and fill table

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER);
INSERT INTO employee 
    (name,age) 
    VALUES 
        ('bob',47);
        ('ann',32);

id          name        age     
----------  ----------  ----------
1           bob         47    
2           ann         32
```

## NULL data

* `('rex')` is missing the age parameter, it fallsback to default value NULL

```sql
INSERT INTO employee (name,age) VALUES ('rex');

id          name        age     
----------  ----------  ----------
1           rex         NULL
```

## Basic Query - Order, LessThan, Distinct

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name='lancor';
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE age>=16 AND hinta<=36;
--ORDER defaults ASC smallest(top) to largest(bottom)
SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY name; 
--largest(top) to smallest(bottom)
SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY name DESC; 
--remove repeats
SELECT DISTINCT age FROM employee; 

SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id IN (1,5,7,4);

SELECT name, 
	CASE WHEN (monthlymaintenance > 100) THEN
		'expensive'
	ELSE
		'cheap'
	END as cost
	from cd.facilities;     
```

## Update data

```sql
UPDATE employee SET name='anna', age=9 WHERE id=2;
UPDATE employee SET age=age+1 WHERE id=2;

UPDATE Tuotteet SET age=age+1; 
```


## Delete data

* Note: Drop != Delete, Delete clears data, Drop destroys the table

```sql
DELETE FROM employee WHERE id=5;

DELETE FROM employee; --deletes all rows, results in empty table
```

## Drop

```sql
DROP TABLE employee;
```

# Counting Scenarios

## Count Num Rows

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee; --Counts all rows

COUNT(*)
----------
5
```

## Count Non-Null Rows

```sql
SELECT COUNT(age) FROM employee;

COUNT(age)
----------
4
```

## Count Unique Occurences

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT age) FROM employee;

COUNT(DISTINCT age)
----------
2
```

# String Scenarios

## Concat

```sql
select surname || ' aka ' || firstname as name from cd.members 
--"BOB" "JONES"
--outputs "BOB aka JONES"
```

## Case insensitive Search

```sql
select * from cd.facilities where upper(name) like 'TENNIS%';      
```

## Regex matching

```sql
select memid, telephone from cd.members where telephone similar to '%[()]%';
```

## Padding string

```sql
select lpad(cast(zipcode as char(5)),5,'0') zip from cd.members order by zip 

--input: 43
--output: 00043
```

# Grouping

* Math analogue: Preimage, Set partition

## Group same names then count each

```sql
select substr (mems.surname,1,1) as letter, count(*) as count 
    from cd.members mems
    group by letter
    order by letter          

letter	count
B	5
C	2
D	1
F	2
G	2
```

# 1-by-1 table = value

* 1 by 1 tables can be auto-casted as values
  * aggregation operators like `max` indicate 1-by-1 tables

```sql
select firstname, surname, joindate
	from cd.members
	where joindate = (select max(joindate) from cd.members);

--(select max(joindate) from cd.members)  is a 1-by-1 table 
```

# Recursion

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE counter AS (
    SELECT 1 AS i
    UNION ALL
    SELECT i+1 FROM counter WHERE i < 5
    )    SELECT i FROM counter;
```

# INNERJOIN 

```sql
--select those that recommend themselves
select distinct recs.firstname as firstname, recs.surname as surname
	from 
		cd.members mems
		inner join cd.members recs
			on recs.memid = mems.recommendedby
order by surname, firstname; 
```

## transitivity

* 3rd degree transitive relation

```txt
Herietta  --recBY-> Matthew  --recBY-> Gerald --recBY-> Darren
Ramnaresh --recBY-> Florence --recBY-> Ponder --recBY-> Burton
Douglas   --recBy-> David    --recBY-> Janice --recBY-> Darren
```

```sql
select distinct recs.firstname as rootrecommender, abc2.firstname as thirdhoprecommended
	from 
		
		(cd.members mems
		inner join cd.members recs
			on recs.memid = mems.recommendedby)  --first hop
			inner join cd.members abc
				on mems.memid = abc.recommendedby --second hop
					inner join cd.members abc2
						on abc.memid = abc2.recommendedby --third hop
;    
--using SELECT, we can only choose information about those with
--level 3 nested recommendations.
--BUT THAT also means out of level 3 we can choose 1,2,3 recommendations
```
