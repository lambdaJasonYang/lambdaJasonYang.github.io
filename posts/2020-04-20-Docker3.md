# Network

* Imagine a scenario when you want your backend container to connect to your DB container
  * BAD: Expose the backend container port, and the DB container port to the outside world then attempt to used each of their respective exposed port to talk.
  * GOOD: docker-compose has a default DNS server that gives containers their domain name based on the label we used their docker-compose file.  
    * Example `myAwesomeDB:5432` translates into `192.168.4.4:5432` with docker-compose.yml
