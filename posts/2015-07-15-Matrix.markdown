PCA is dimensional reduction  
Multiple features can be reduced to 2 axis, PCA-1, PCA-2  
The resulting 2 axis PCA-1,PCA-2 are orthogonal  


To interpret a 2d PCA chart, look at how closely the points are to each other in each axis.  
Two points that are the most different will be diagonally distant (far x distance, far y distance)
