# HTTP vs HTTPS

* HTTP: HTTP -- TCP -- IP --> Ethernet  
* HTTPS: HTTP -- TLS(SSL) -- TCP -- IP -- Ethernet

# HTTP/1.1 

Sequential, 

  * can only send 1 request at time
  * must wait for response before sending a new request

# HTTP/2

Multiplex(Async), 

  * send multiple requests
  * wait for response in any order


  ### Certificate Authority

  * CA public key is pre-installed in most Client browsers
  * CA private key: Some lesser website will ask the CA to sign their public-private key pairs to certify authenticity.

  Example CA: LetsEncrypt
