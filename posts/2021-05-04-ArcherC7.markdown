title: 2021 OpenWrt - Why your Archer C7 mesh isn't Working on 5Ghz
tags: tech, openwrt, homeserver
---

As of 2021, the default drivers that comes installed with the archer C7 is not compatible with 5Ghz mesh even though it works for 2.5Ghz mesh.

We have to remove the default drivers( the ct version) and install the non-ct version as shown below.

opkg remove ath10k-firmware-qca988x-ct kmod-ath10k-ct
opkg install ath10k-firmware-qca988x kmod-ath10k

If you get an error as shown below then you have to run opkg update

Unknown package 'ath10k-firmware-qca988x'.
Unknown package 'kmod-ath10k'.
Collected errors:
 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package ath10k-firmware-qca988x.
 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-ath10k.

If you get an error running opkg update then

root@OpenWrt:~# opkg update

Adjust your settings

Go to your settings Interfaces > LAN >> Advanced Settings tab, 
Use Custom DNS servers: 8.8.8.8

then do opkg update and it should work and continue the previous steps.
Afterwards reboot your router and your mesh should work.
