title: YCombinators and Russell's paradox

Russell's paradox starts by designing a Set S that contains/specifies all Sets that are not elements of itself.
$$ S = \{ x | x \notin x \} \tag{1}$$
Next we ask can S be an element of S?  
[Assume S is element of itself] 
$$S \in S \tag{2}$$   
[This would imply by definition (1)]
$$S \notin S \tag{3}$$
[By contradiction (2) and (3)]  
$$S \notin S \tag{4}$$

[but by the definition of (1) ]  
$$S \in S \tag{5}$$  
...thus the whole process repeats infinitely  
It is a paradox because there is no end to this proof, meaning we cannot conclude whether it is true or false.

The resolution is to bound the universe so that S must be within some universe.

### Analogy
In set theory, the propositional function is elementhood.
Elementhood takes two sets (lets call the universe that contain all sets SET) and return a truth value.  
$$ \in :: (SET,SET) \rightarrow bool $$ 

First lets analyze the $$(SET,\in)$$ .
elementhood(granny smith,red apples) is true only when the proposition granny smith is red is true.

Let's design ano hter theory $$(BEAR, like)$$
like(Smokey, honey bears) is true only when proposition Smokey eats honey is true.

Lets design another paradox using groups of bears and "like".
$$ like :: (BEAR,BEAR) \rightarrow bool $$

S = a group of bears that Specifies groups of bears that do not like themselves

Notice the analog
	$$ Set of Elements \approx Group of Bears $$
    $$ \in \approx like $$

Here we have a group of bears that do not like other bears.

We select wlog an arbitrary bear of such group, Smokey.
We say Smoke likes Smokey.
