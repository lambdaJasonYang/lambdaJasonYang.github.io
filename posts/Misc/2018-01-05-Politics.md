# Public Sector role in Economy

* Over last 40yr, public sector not growing as fast as private sector
  * Neglect:  
    * ports 
    * power grid
    * public education, esp. early childhood
    * job training
<!--  -->
* Weak public sector is especially dangerous in black swan events like Covid
  * No internet, No remote edu for poor
  * Capacity constraint of Ports, shocked supply chain
<!--  -->
* Problem + Solutions:
  * Prob: Larger earnings gap, weak labor laws
    * Sol: Higher min wage, Protect unions
  * Prob: Multinational corporates avoid taxes by hiding income in other countries
    * Sol: Global cooporation on taxes
<!--  -->
* Trends even before COVID
  * One of most rapid decline in labor participation
    * IMO: Corporate offshoring and refusing to train entry level for white collar work
