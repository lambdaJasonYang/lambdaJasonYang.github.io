# Essentials

```bash
Alt+U | undo
Ctrl+R | redo
```

# Multifile

```bash
:qall! | quit all without saving
:qallw | quit all with saving
```

## Single screen

Vi can take multiple files as arguments called buffers.  
THIS IS NOT split screen.


```bash

:ls ,list buffers

:bnext ,moves focus to next buffer
:bprevious, moves focus to previous buffer
:
```


## Split screen

```bash
vi -o2 file1.txt file2.txt

```

```bash
Ctrl+W H | focus left window
Ctrl+W J | focus up window
Ctrl+W K | focus down window
Ctrl+W L | focus right window
```

Add another split

```bash
:split newfile.txt
```
