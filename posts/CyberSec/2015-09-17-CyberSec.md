# Reminders

* Stack- stores local variables inside functions. Local variables and Values get destroyed after function call returns.
* Heap- `new` allows local variables to persist after function call. Only destroyed with `delete`. Only Heap cause mem leaks. 

# Examples

> Code has buffer overflow due to `memcpy`, but you use a compiler that uses stack canaries. Which is better **random canaries** or **terminator canaries** for security?

* (GOOD) Random canaries -Attack has to guess 
* (BAD) Terminator canary - Terminator canary contains NULL(0x00), CR (0x0d), LF (0x0a), and EOF (0xff) after a string . only useful for `strcpy`; wont help against `memcpy` bc memcpy can overwrite the canary. the canary. 

> You visit page using VPN w. **passive mixed content**(HTTPS loads <img> subresources from a cdn that uses insecure HTTP). If your VPN service is evil, what exploit can they use?

  * VPN service can change/replace the image. 

> Can VPN service inject javascipt with an onload attribute using `<img src=".." onload="possibleAttack?">`.
  
  * No since onload is part of the HTTPS page which is secure from VPN attack.

>  Are XSS attacks affected by cookies marked **secure**? how about marked **httponly**?

  * (BAD) secure: not effective
  * (GOOD) httponly: blocks script access and completely stops XSS

> NX pages: **NX bit** is security feature on processors which mark certain pages of memory as non-executable. Explain what this prevents. 
 
  * Prevents stack-based buffer overflows

> Which segments is NX bit set for: stack,heap,code?
 
  * mainly stack and sometimes heap

> Does NX bit require re-compiling old code.
 
  * No since only the kern

> Does NX bit have permance penalty?
 
  * No

> Name an advanced version of the stack-based buffer overflow which can evade NX bit.
 
  * Heap-based buffer overflow and ROP-return oriented programming which returns to your malicious library.

> Suppose you build an encrypted web app which stores keys in browser local storage. You think of implementing PGP or OTR. (remember OTR offers **forward secrecy** but PGP does not). What can a XSS attack on your site do? 

  * XSS injection could read keys from local storage but OTR

> Which PGP or OTR is better against this XSS attack?

  * OTR is better since leaked keys can only be used to read old messages.

> Some UNIX distro has a user called **nobody** with no access rights to file system. Bob downloaded a program foo and set it with `-r-sr-xr-x 1 nobody nogroup foo`. What does this do?
 
  * The **setuid bit** is a linux principle that means when running an executable, **system permissions** are set to the user that created it(nobody) instead of the user that launched it(Bob)
  * Anyone can run `foo` but `foo` wont be able to write or corrupt our file system or processes. 
  * Essentially this is program isolation.

> What is DKIM and how does it preevnt spam?

  * DKIM(Domain Key Identified Mail) adds a signature to each email message using a the email domain specified key. 
  * You can verify if the email really came from a gmail account by checking the email signature.

> Describe **ACLs** vs. **Capabilities** 
 
  * ACL(Access Control Lists) - behaves like a bouncer that checks their DB if you are on-the-list.
    * Pro: Disallow sharing
    * Pro: Centrally manage therefore Easy to manage
    * Con: Very specific to an app or system therefore not reusable. (Bouncer can't just use his on-the-list on the other bar across town)
  * Capabilities - behaves like a metal detector
    * Pro: Anonymous access
    * Pro: Abstract broad policies making it easy to share
    * Con: Harder to revoke
  
# Guide

## Symmetric Crypto

| Primitive | Function | Property | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hash function | H(x) -> y | Collision-Resistant<br /> One-way | SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA3 <br /> MD5,SHA1 are broken |
| Symmetric Encryption | KeyGen() -> k <br /> Encrypt(m,k) -> c <br /> Decrypt(k,c) -> m | Semantic Security | Stream Ciphers (RC-4, AES-CTR) <br /> Block Ciphers(AES-CBC, DES-CBC) <br /> ECB is not secure|
| MAC (Message Auth. Code) | KeyGen() -> k <br /> MAC(m,k) -> t | Existential unforgeability | HMAC | 
| Authenticated Encryption | Encryption + MAC | Semantic Security <br /> Existential unforgeability | AES-GCM |



## Asymmetric Crypto

| Primitive | Function | Property | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public-Key encryption | KeyGen() -> (k_pub, k_priv) <br /> Encrypt(m,k_pub) -> c <br /> Decrypt(c, k_priv) -> m | Semantic Security | RSA, El Gamal, EC El Gamal |
| Digital Signature | KeyGen() -> (k_pub, k_priv) <br /> Sign(m,k_priv) -> s <br /> Verify(s,k_pub) -> Bool | Existential unforgeability | RSA, DSA, ECDSA |
| Key Exchange | KeyGen -> (x, g^x^ ) <br /> KeyDerive(x, g^y^) -> g^xy^ | Key is indistinguishable from Random | Diffie-Hellman| 

* TLS key exchange - RSA-style and DH-style
  * DH-style is resistant to passive attacks and provide forward secrecy
* TLS key exchange involves exchanging a hash of the transcript (downgrade attacks)
* PKI - Certificates tie public keys to names signed by Certificate authority
* X.509 Certs: Mu
* PGP - Encryption for email. Async. Web of trust. No forward secrecy.
* OTR/Signal - Encryption for real time chat. Synchronous (DH-style key exchange). Key ratcheting for forward secrecy
* Cryptocurrency - use Digital signatures to authorize payments and blockchain to record transactions and prevent double spend

## Network Security

| Primitive | Function | Property | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data | Ethernet, Wifi, GSM | Local connection to Internet | Ethernet: none <br /> Wifi: WEP/WPA <br /> GSM: A5, GEA
| Network | IP | Send packets to IP address in best-effort | IPSEC ( VPNS) |
| Transport | TCP, UDP | TCP: Reliable Ordered Delivery w/ Congestion control <br /> UDP: Fast Best-effort | TLS/SSL(TCP) <br /> Tor<br /> DTLS (UDP) |
| Application | HTTP, SMTP, FTP, SSH | HTTP: connect to web server <br /> SMTP: email | HTTPS |

Each layer has: 

* Confidentiality - Who can eavesdrop? (passive attacker)
* Integrity - Who can modify data? (access control)
* Access Control - Who can send data? (DDOS attacker)
* Availability - Who can block data (jammers)

Concepts:

* Tor - Adds anonymity via 3 relays with layered encryption( onion encryption).
  * Local observer cannot pair client IP with server IP.
  * Vulnerable to traffic fingerprinting
  * Tor hides client IP from server
  * Tor hidden services hide server IP from client

## System Security

### Access Control


* Subject/Principal - user ID, real name, IP address
* Object/Resource - file, web page, network resource, IO device
* Permission - Read, Write, Execute, Append, Change Ownership
* Roles - Set of Subjects/Principals (students, faculty)
* Labels - Set of Object/Resources (Sensitive, Unclassified)
<!--  -->
* ACL(Access Control List) - is like a bouncer with a list of names w/ some in VIP
  * Store a list of subjects + permissions with each resource
* Capabilities
* Gives Subject/Principal handles which represent Permission to access Object/Resource
<!--  -->

POSIX permissions model

* All process are ran with a user ID and Group ID
* Processes can run with elevate privilege if `setuid` or `setgid` bits are set

| Permission | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| `-rwsr-x--x 1 alice acct` | Alice (Owner) can read, write, execute. <br /> Member of `acct` group can read,execute. <br /> `Others` can only execute <br /> Setuid bit means program will run with alice's privilege. | 
| `-r-xr----- 1 bob admin` | Bob (Owner) can read, execute <br /> Members of `admin` group can read. <br /> `Others` have no permission
| `-r-xr-sr-x 1 carol gurus` | Anybody can read, execute <br /> Setgid bit means program will run with `gurus` group privilege | 

* Privilege escalation attack - Exploit which tricks priileged programs intro running arbitrary code.

## Memory 

* NOP Sled - Reduce effectiveness of ASLR with a large buffer to jump to
* Heap overflow - evade NX bits and Stack canaries
* ROP: Evade canaries, ASLR, NX bits

## Web

### Password Storage

* Hash password so DB leaks dont reveal actual password, and since hash function is one way, it is difficult to get the real password.
* Add **salt**(~64 bit) to prevent dictionary attack or parallel attack on hashed password.
* Iterated hashes make brute-force attacks harder

### Authentication Cookies

* Commit to username, expiration. Use a MAC!
* Mark auth cookies as `secure, httponly`
