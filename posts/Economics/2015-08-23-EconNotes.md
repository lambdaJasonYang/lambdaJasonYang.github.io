# Geometric Series 
Summary

LINEAR PROG
ASSUMPTIONS
INPUT Cost-function, decision-variable
OUTPUT optimal-decision-variables

OPTIMAL TRANSPORT is example of LINEAR PROG
Two types of nodes, supply nodes(initial object) and demand nodes(terminal object)
Each initial object has required min capacity
Each terminal object has required min capacity

The decision variable are basically the intensity of edge between these nodes.  
More intense edges mean more items delivered between nodes.
