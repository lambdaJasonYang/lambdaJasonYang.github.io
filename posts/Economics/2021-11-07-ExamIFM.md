# Risk-free interest rate

* Use interest rate to Translate "Strike Price -> Present Value"
  * You get offered a contract to get $100 in a year aka Strike Price BUT  
  what is that $100 Really worth Now(Present Value)  ?
    * Assuming 5% risk-free interest rate compounded monthly:  
    $100 \times (1+(0.05)\frac{1}{12})^{12}$
    * Another common phrase is 5% risk-free interest rate **compounded continuously**:  
    $100 \times e^{1+0.05}$

# Put-Call Parity is a Forward contract

$$CallPrice + (\frac{OptionStrike}{riskFreeRate}) \stackrel{?}{=} PutPrice + StockPrice$$



* Holding Put and Call Options of the same (strike price, Expiration date) is Equal to  
Holding Forward Contract with the same Expiration date 
  * Forward Price of Contract is same as Option strike price
