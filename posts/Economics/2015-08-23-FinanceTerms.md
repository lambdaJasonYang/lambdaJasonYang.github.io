 Seasonality analysis 

Keeping track of random terms on Investopedia

> Examples are better than definitions

# Average return

* SPY return -4.45% 2018 , 31.29% 2019 , 18.25% 2020   
  * SPY 3-year average return is 15.0633%

# T-distribution

* T-dist is a probability dist like a normal-dist but bigger tails
  * infinite degree of freedom result in T-dist = normal-dist
* smaller degree of freedoms imply bigger tails
* Can be useful to model returns with fat fails

# Useless

Volume-Weighted Avg Price(VWAP): not useful, used by big funds to see if trade will affect price



# Corporate terms

## Costs

### Fixed Cost
* rent, subscription

### Variable Cost
