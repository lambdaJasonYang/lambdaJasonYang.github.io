$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = r_B N ( 1 - \frac{N}{K_B} ) - p(N)$$

$N$ is population size
$r_B$ is Linear Birth rate
$K_B$ is carrying capacity related to amount of food
$p(N)$ is predation by predators

### Dimensional analysis
Design a dimensionless function for p(N)

design variables

### Finding the stable state
Plot the D(f(x)) vs f(x)
assume f(x) = population at time x

Where the graph crosses 0 are the stable states. Showing there is no change in population.

This means for every time x, we need to make a plot.
