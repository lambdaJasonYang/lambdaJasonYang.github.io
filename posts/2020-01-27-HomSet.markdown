HomSet in programming terms are simply the types of the functions.

Nested HomSets are simply the types of curried functions.

### Translate Homset to function type notation

$$ f :: A \rightarrow B := f \in Hom(A, B) $$
$$ f :: A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C) := f \in Hom(A, Hom(B,C)) $$
$$ f :: (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow C := f \in Hom(Hom(A,B),C) $$

### Free Monoid

* object : T
* Morphism : Alphabet = {a,b,c...} map T --> T
* Composition : Append

The Free Monoid on the alphabet results in the set of all possible words/strings created from the alphabet.

##### Free monoid on number 

Addition mod 2 group is a category 

* 1+1 = 0
* 1+0 = 1

Category

* object : T
* morphisms: numbers {0,1} 
* composition: addition
* Identity morphism: 0

Checking composition:
(1+1)+1 = 1+(1+1)
