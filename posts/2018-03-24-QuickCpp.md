# Virtual functions

* problem: classes that extend base classes will call base class method on compile time.
  * What if constructed using `Animal x = new Cat()` instead of canonical `Cat x = new Cat()`
    * `x.voice()` x will only call it's base class `Animal` methods. BAD
* solution: virtual method allow dynamic binding so the proper object method is found and called on run time
   * make `x.voice()` a virtual function
     * x will now call it's proper Object method `Cat` which is discovered on run time.

```c++
class Base
{
  public:
            void Method1 ()  {  std::cout << "Base::Method1" << std::endl;  }
    virtual void Method2 ()  {  std::cout << "Base::Method2" << std::endl;  }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
  public:
    void Method1 ()  {  std::cout << "Derived::Method1" << std::endl;  }
    void Method2 ()  {  std::cout << "Derived::Method2" << std::endl;  }
};

Base* basePtr = new Derived ();
  //  Note - constructed as Derived, but pointer stored as Base*

basePtr->Method1 ();  //  Prints "Base::Method1"
basePtr->Method2 ();  //  Prints "Derived::Method2"
```
