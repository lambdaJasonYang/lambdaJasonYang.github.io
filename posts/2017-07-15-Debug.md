# Stack trace

If you program hits an exception typically a stack trace gets printed.  
Stack trace is the set of functions/modules that were previously called that lead up to the exception.

# Unit testing

## Test Object initialization


```js
@Test
test CarGasInitTest(){
    Car = new Car();
    assertEq(0,Car.gas);
}

```
