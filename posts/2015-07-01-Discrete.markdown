main function $f :: D \rightarrow R$

$R$ is the CoDomain

#### Surjective

$$ {\color{blue}R \overset{inv}{\longrightarrow}} D \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} R $$


* Exists identity for Range (Right identity)
  * by hitting our main function **From behind**
  * $f$ partitions it's preimage $D$ meaning $inv$ must **choose** any element within it's partition.
    * Choice function 

---

#### Injective

$$ D \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} R{\color{blue} \overset{inv}{\longrightarrow} D} $$

* Exists identity for Domain (Left identity)
  * by **Extending** our main function with an inverse

#### Examples Surjective

$Senators \overset{Elected}{\longrightarrow} PresidentialCandidates$   

$PresidentialCandidates \overset{ElectedBy}{\longrightarrow} Senators$

* In literary terms, passive voice inverts the active action.
  * Senator Bob and Ruth **Elected** President Bush
  * President Bush was **Elected By** Senator Bob and Ruth


#### 

All linear functions f(x) have f''(x) = 0


#### Inverses

Given exponential function f(x), find g(x) st. f(g(x)) = kx with k as constant

We can solve using inflection point 2nd derivative method.
We know that the second derivative of 
$$f(g(x))'' = 0$$
$$(f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x))' = 0$$



#### Even and Odd

$$\times \mapsto OR $$
$$+ \mapsto XAND $$

XAND means true iff both parity are the same


$\times \mapsto OR$

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \times Q$ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E | E | E |
| E | O | E |
| O | E | E |
| O | O | O |


$+ \mapsto XAND$

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P + Q$ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E | E | E |
| E | O | O |
| O | E | O |
| O | O | E |

* XAND is also known as XNOR
