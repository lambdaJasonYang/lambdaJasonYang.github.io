main function $f :: D \rightarrow R$

$R$ is the CoDomain

---

#### Surjective

$$ {\color{blue}R \overset{inv}{\longrightarrow}} D \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} R $$


* Exists identity for Range (Right identity)
  * by hitting our main function **From behind**
  * $f$ partitions it's preimage $D$ meaning $inv$ must **choose** any element within it's partition.
    * Choice function 

---

#### Injective

$$ D \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} R{\color{blue} \overset{inv}{\longrightarrow} D} $$

* Exists identity for Domain (Left identity)
  * by **Extending** our main function with an inverse

#### Examples Surjective

$Senators \overset{Elected}{\longrightarrow} PresidentialCandidates$   

$PresidentialCandidates \overset{ElectedBy}{\longrightarrow} Senators$

* In literary terms, passive voice inverts the active action.
  * Senator Bob and Ruth **Elected** President Bush
  * President Bush was **Elected By** Senator Bob and Ruth
