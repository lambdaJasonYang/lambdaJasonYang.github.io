### Tokenizer

Tokenizing is simply the act of converting a string to a list of elements.

### A Very Simple LISP math eval for AST

* Racket treats list like (+ 2 3) as AST.
  * Head of list is the operator.  
  * Tail of list are the arguments 

```python
def helperStr_Int(k):
    try:
        return int(k)
    except:
        return k

str_to_OP={"+": lambda x,y: x+y}

def eval_naive(AST):
    operator = str_to_OP[AST[0]]
    args = list(map(lambda x: helperStr_Int(x),AST[1:]))
    return operator(*args)

test = ["+","2","3"]

eval_naive(["+","2","3"])
```

### Eval with nested AST
```python
str_to_OP={"+": lambda x,y: x+y,
           "define": lambda x:3}

def helperStr_Int(k):
    try:
        return int(k)
    except:
        return k

def eval_naive(AST):
    operator = str_to_OP[AST[0]]
    args = list(map(lambda x: helperStr_Int(x) ,AST[1:]))
    RECURSEargs = list(map(lambda x: eval_naive(x) if isinstance(x,list) else x, args))
    #Recursively calls eval if another AST is found in the args.
    return operator(*RECURSEargs)

eval_naive(["+",["+","1","2"],"3"])
```

### Using Lambdas to define a local environment

In lambda calculus we can think of everything as a lambdas, everything including the local environment.

$(\lambda x. sourceCode)(2) \Rightarrow sourceCode[2/variable]$   
```python
x=2
###sourceCode
if(..):
  doSomething(x)
  y=x*..
.....
###sourceCode
```  

We can't do this naively in python because python does eager evaluation.  

A way to get around that is converting everything to string then using `eval`{.python} which simulates a lazy evaluation.




```python
#wrapCode builds our lazy lambda expression string
def wrapCode(sourceCode,var,val):
    return f"(lambda {var}: {sourceCode})({val})"

wrapCode(wrapCode("print(x+y)","x",2),"y",3)
#> '(lambda y: (lambda x: print(x+y))(2))(3)'

eval(wrapCode(wrapCode("print(x+y)","x",2),"y",3))
#> 5
```
