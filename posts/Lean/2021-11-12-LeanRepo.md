Most of the basic lemmas and functions will be in `Init` directory  

Option,some,none is Maybe,Just,Nothing  

```{.hs filename="/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4/src/lean/Init/Data/List/BasicAux.lean"}
--BasicAux.lean

--different ways to get an element from a List:

-- if you define a function based on this get!
-- the function must also assume [Inhabited α]
def get! [Inhabited α] ... 

-- This is the Option get that returns a Just _ or none
def get? ... 

def head
def tail
def getLast
```

```C++
typedef struct {
    int      m_rc; //reference counter - used for garbage collection 
    unsigned m_cs_sz:16; //object size - used for garbage collection
    unsigned m_other:8; //#fields of a constructor object or element size of array
    unsigned m_tag:8; //
} lean_object;


//linear logic applied to lean function arguments
//The "resource" is the reference counter of the ARGUMENT of some function call which can be consumed or not



/* The following typedef's are used to document the calling convention for the primitives. */
//All of these are just pointers to a lean_object

/* Standard object argument: 
Argument's reference counter is viewed as resource that is consumed when called by a function.
A function call like `f(lean_obj_arg x)` means it is safe to mutate aka "destructive update" `x` if the reference counter of x is 1.
[In C++, this is `f(shared_ptr<leanobj>&& x)` ]
 */
typedef lean_object * lean_obj_arg;   

/* Borrowed object argument convention:
We use this to say argument's reference counter doesnt automically get consumed when called by a function meaning it is responsibility of caller to decrement the reference counter.  
[In C++, this is `f(shared_ptr<leanobj> const& x)` ]
 */

/* Unique (aka non shared) object argument. like unique_ptr in C++ */
typedef lean_object * u_lean_obj_arg; 

//Below are the function return conventions. Aka function will return a ptr to a leanObject and the convention tells us if we have to do something after the return. 

/*If a function return type is `lean_obj_res` then whoever called that function is responsible for consuming the reference counter. 
[In C++, this mean returning a smart_ptr by value] */
typedef lean_object * lean_obj_res;   /* Standard object result. */

/*Borrowed result, The caller is not responsible for decreasing the reference counter
[In C++, this means function returns `shared_ptr<leanobj> const&` aka a reference to a smart pointer. ] */

`std::shared_ptr` allows multiple `std::shared_ptr`'s to point to the same object. It keeps the number of pointers pointing to the number as the **reference counter**. Once the counter hits 0, the object is deallocated.

* Passing smart pointer by value to a function means it has been copied meaning that the reference counter has increased by one.
