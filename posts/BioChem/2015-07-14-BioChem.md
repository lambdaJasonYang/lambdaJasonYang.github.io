# Acid-Base

## Terminology

$$ \overset{acid}{HA} + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + \overset{base}{A^-}$$

  
* **p_** in front of **pK~a~,pK~b~,pH,pOH** always means **-log(..)**
  * **pH + pOH = 14**
    * **pH = -log([H^+^])**
    * **pOH = -log([OH^-^])**
  * **pK~a~ + pKb = 14**
    * **pK~a~ = -log(K~a~)**
    * **pK~b~ = -log(K~b~)**
<!--  -->
* **K~a~** acid dissociation constant aka strength of acid
<!--  -->
* **pI** is the pH when protein has no net electrical charge.


## Problem Set

> Triprotic acid, HA, Ka1 is 10^-2^, Ka2 is 10^-6^ and Ka3 is 10^-10^ . THe pH range in which H~3~A^-^ is the predominant form is a pH between?
  
* 3 and 5

> A unknown weak acid, HA has a Ka of 10^-5^. If 0.1 mole of this acid is dissolved in one liter of water, the percentage of acid dissoaciated at equilibrium is closest to?

$$\displaylines{ [HA] = 0.1M \\ 
\overset{0.1-x}{HA} \rightleftharpoons \overset{x}{H} + \overset{x}{A} \\
1 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{[H][A]}{[HA]} \\
1 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{x^2}{0.1} \\
x = 10^{-3}
}$$

> What is the pKa for trimethylammonium in water if the base ionization constant (Kb) for trimethylamine is 7.4*10^-5^ ?

pKa + pKb = 14  
pKb = -log(7.4*10^-5^) = 4.13  
pka = 14 - 4.13 = 9.87  

> DNA polymerase contains a lysine residue that is important for binding o DNA. Mutations were found that converted this lysine to either glutamate, glycine, valine or arginine. Which mutations would be predicted to be the most and least harmful to the ability of the enzyme to bind DNA?   
   
Arginine is least harmful b/c basic like Lysine and ionizable.  
Glycine is most harmful b/c nonpolar meaning it will not bind to DNA.

> The  quantitative differences in biological activity between the two enantiomers of a compound are sometimes quite large. For example, the D isomer of the drug isoproterenol, used to treat mild asthma, is 50 to 80 times more effective as a bronchodilator than the L isomer. Identify the Chiral center is isoproterenol. Why might 2 enantiomers have such radically different bioactivity?  

Because they cannot act on the same binding site

> A Peptide has the sequence: Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly  
a) Draw the structure of peptide and state it's single letter sequence  
b) What is the net charge of the molecule at pH 3, pH 8, pH 11  
c) Estimate the pI for this peptide  

| pH | N-Term | Glu(E) | His(H) | Trp(Y) | Ser(S) | Gly(G) | Leu(L) | Arg(R) | Pro(P) | Gly(G) | C-term | Net | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 3 | +1 | 0 | +1 | - | - | - | +1 | - | - | -0.5 | +2.5 |
| 8 | +0.5 | -1 | 0 | - | - | - | +1 | - | - | -1 | -0.5 |
| 11 | 0 | -1 | 0 | - | - | - | +1 | - | - | -1 | -1 |
| (Deduced)6 | +1 | -1 | +0.5 | - | - | - | +1 | - | - | -1 | +0.5 |

Even though we we never asked to write out the row of charges for pH 6,  
we noticed that the net charge of 0 must be between pH 3 and pH 8, so we make a guess that pH 6 should be where Net Charge may be close to 0.  
But we were off since it's pH 6 has a Net Charge of +0.5.  
Therefore another deduction is $pI=\frac{6+8}{2}=7$ , meaning pI for this peptide is 7.
  
> Histones are proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei, tightly bound to DNA, which has many phosphate groups. The pI of histones is very high, about 10.8. What amino acid residues must be present in relatively large numbers in histones? In what way do these residues contribute to the strong binding site of histones to DNA?  

arginine b/c the charge creates ionic interactions


# Tm and Syn-Anti

## Problem set  

> Explain the Tm trend in Kool's P phi experiments. Account for the Tm differences between rows 3,4,8,9,10, 12. The trend is as follows in order of decreasing Tm:  
A-T > P-P > P-phi > A-P >> A-phi  

A-T has a high Tm b/c it is a base pair that hydrogen bonds.  
P-P is second because there is steric hinderence but they stack on each other and have hydrophobic interactions.  
P-phi is third because the P is unpaired but more hydrophobic and larger than A.  
A-P is fourth b/c it is steric   

> The Tm of a certain 10mer DNA duplex is typically 50C. In the presence of an intercalating dye, ethidium, the structure of which is shown below, the Tm increases to 70C. Explain  

The dye stabilizes the DNA in between the spaces of the base pair through hydrophobic interaction.  

> Which confirmation of A exists in B-DNA? 

![Syn vs Anti adenosine](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajmuhon-Nongmaithem/publication/287567889/figure/fig1/AS:668984928137226@1536509844786/Anti-and-Syn-conformations-of-adenosine.png){height=200 width=500}

Anti because the hydrophilic phosphate group needs to face the outside  
while the hydrophobic base pair will be more stable inside, closer to it's matching base pair.



> The drug cordycepin is 3'-dexyadenosine. In vivo the drug is converted to the triphosphate and inhibits RNA synthesis. How might the drug accomplish this? (figure shown)

![](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?cid=248010&t=l){height=150 width=150}

The drug will bind as a base pair and end the sequence since there is no Hydroxyl group on the 3' end.

# Enzymes and Inhibition

General Equation for Inhibition is given by:  

$$v = V_{max} \frac{[S]}{K_M \alpha + [S] \beta }$$

| Type | $\alpha$ |  $\beta$  | Eqn |
| --- | ----- | -----| ------|
| Mixed Inhibition | $\alpha = 1 + \frac{I}{K_i}$ |  $\beta = 1 + \frac{[I]}{K_i'}$ | |
| Competitive Inhibition | $\alpha = 1 + \frac{I}{K_i}$ | $\beta = 1$ | |
| UnCompetitive Inhibition | $\alpha = 1$ | $\beta = 1 + \frac{[I]}{K_i'}$ | |
| NonCompetitive Inhibition | $\alpha = 1 + \frac{I}{K_i}$ | $\beta = 1 + \frac{I}{K_i}$ | |

# Proteins

## Concepts

* Proteins are chains of amino acids
* Amino acids have a **N-terminus, C-terminus** thus Proteins also have this
  * N-terminus is a free amine group aka amino terminus
  * C-terminus is a free caryboxylic group aka carboxyl terminus

## Terminology

* Monoclonal antibody - Antibodies that bind to one specific epitope
* His-tag - A tag that can be used in affinity chromatography so that other particles can elute first
* Blosum 62 - A system to gauge conservation of amino acid sequences
* Chargaff's Rules - Rules that states "% moles of A = T" and "% moles of G = C"

## Problem Set

> Propose a quaternary structure for protein complex formed from different subunits with squares representing proteins. Connect them with lines representing disulfide bonds.   
  + The mass of the protein complex is 240 kD ( 1 kD=1000 times mass of H) determined by sedimentation velocity.  
  + On SDS PAGE, 2 bands are seen, one with MW=200kD, second with MW=10kD.  
  + On SDS PAGE, after treated with mercaptoethanol, 3 bands are seen, one at 80kD, one at 30kD, one at 10kD  
  + After treating the native protein with increasing concentrations of a bifunctional cross-linking reagent like glutaraldehyde, which covalently joins lysine residues that are close in space, the products show new bands on SDS PAGE, at 210kD, 220 kD, 230 kD, 240kD. The original bands at 200kD and 10kD decrease in intensity.

> Bacillus brevis contains a peptide with antibiotic properties. This peptide disrupts ion transport across the cell membranes of other bacterial species, killing them. Determine the primary structure of the peptide given the following observations.  
+ Complete acid hydrolysis of hte peptide followed byamino acid analysis yielded equimolar amounts of Leu, Lys, Phe, Pro and Val.  
a) Molecular weight of the peptide was estimated to be about 1100 daltons (assume residues have avg molecular weight of 110 daltons)  
b) The peptide failed to undergo hydrolysis when treated with the enzyme carboxypeptidase. This enzyme catalyzes the hydolysis of the carboxy-terminal residue of a polypeptide unless the residue is Pro or does not contain a free carboxyl group.  
c) Edman degradation did not yield any PTH products.  
d) Partial hydrolysis of the peptide followed by chromatographic separation and sequence analysis yielded the following di- and tripeptides.  
(Leu-Phe, Phe-Pro, Lys-Leu, Val-Lys, Val-Lys-Leu, Phe-Pro-Val, Pro-Val-Lys)  

Solution:  

piece the fragments together like a puzzle of overlapping sequences  

```txt

Val-Lys-Leu    Phe-Pro  Pro-Val-Lys
         \      /     \     /     \
          Leu-Phe  Phe-Pro-Val    Lys-Leu

        
Unused: Val-Lys     
```

From b), since the entire peptide is 1100 dalton and each amino acid has 110 daltons, we can guess there are only 10 amino acids.  

> Estimate the pI of the peptide in the problem above.  

Solution:  

| pI | N-term | Lys | Lys | C-term | Net |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | 
| 9 | 0 | +1 | +1 | -1 | +1 |
| 7 | +1 | +1 | +1 | -1 | +2 |
| 10 | 0 | +0.5 | +0.5 | -1 | 0 |

pI is 10
