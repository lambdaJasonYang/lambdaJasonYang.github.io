# Basics

## Isomorphisms

* Set: bijective maps
* Mfd(manifolds):  diffeomorphisms
* Top : homeomorphisms which are invertible continuous map with continuous inverses.

## Monomorphisms

* Set: Injective maps
* Top: Injective continuous maps
* FVect(finite-dimension Vect): injective linear map
* Group: injective group homeomorphisms

## Split monomorphisms

* Set: Every injective function has a left inverse. Therefore every monomorphism is split.
* FVect: Every injective linear map has a left inverse. Therefore every monomorphism is split.

* Top: 

> Generally, monomorphisms are not conceptually related to splits even though it looks the case in Set and FVect. General case is Top

## Epimorphism

* Set: Surjective map
* FVect: Surjective continuous linear map
* Algebra: inclusion
  * Natural number is Included in Integers

## Split Epimorphism



# Functors

## Cocycle

Functors are just 1-cocycles

# Yoneda Embedding Theorem

## Matrix Example

A matrix transformation through row operation is a natural transformation between presheaves.  

Matrix transformation by row operation is isomorphic to a matrix

# PreSheaf

A functor that takes a dual morphism to set category.

$$f^{OP} \Rightarrow Set$$
