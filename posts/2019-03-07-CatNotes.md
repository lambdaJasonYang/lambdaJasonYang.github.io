# Basics

## Isomorphisms

* Set: bijective maps
* Mfd(manifolds):  diffeomorphisms
* Top : homeomorphisms which are invertible continuous map with continuous inverses.

## Monomorphisms

* Set: Injective maps
* Top: Injective continuous maps
* FVect(finite-dimension Vect): injective linear map
* Group: injective group homeomorphisms

## Split monomorphisms

* Set: Every injective function has a left inverse. Therefore every monomorphism is split.
* FVect: Every injective linear map has a left inverse. Therefore every monomorphism is split.

* Top: 

> Generally, monomorphisms are not conceptually related to splits even though it looks the case in Set and FVect. General case is Top

## Epimorphism

* Set: Surjective map
* FVect: Surjective continuous linear map
* Algebra: inclusion
  * Natural number is Included in Integers

## Split Epimorphism



# Functors

## Cocycle

Functors are just 1-cocycles

# Yoneda Embedding Theorem

## Matrix Example

A matrix transformation through row operation is a natural transformation between presheaves.  

Matrix transformation by row operation is isomorphic to a matrix

# PreSheaf

A functor that takes a dual morphism to set category.

$$f^{OP} \Rightarrow Set$$

# Applicative



# Natural

* All functors are endofunctors `functor :: Type* => Type*` wrt to coding
  * `List :: Type* => Type*`
  * `Maybe :: Type* => Type*`

Below is a natural transformation wrt Object a on functors List and Maybe  
Natural Transformation can be considered a family of morphisms between functors wrt an object or morphism.


```hs
g :: ∀a b. a -> b 
naturaltransformation_a :: ∀ a. List a -> Maybe a
```

```plantuml
@startuml
digraph foo {
  rankdir = LR
  a [label = "forall a::Type*"]
  
  
  subgraph clustera{
   b [label="List a"]
   c [label="Maybe a"]
   b -> c [color=red label="natural\ntrans"]
  }
  a -> b [color=green label="functor"]
  a -> c [color=green label="functor" ]
}
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
digraph foo {
rankdir=LR

  a [label = "forall a::Type*"]
 a1 [label = "forall b::Type*"]
a->a1 [label="g"]
  
  
  subgraph clustera{
   b [label="List a"]
   c [label="Maybe a"]
   b -> c [color=red label="natural\ntrans"]
  }
  subgraph clusterb{
   b1 [label="List b"]
   c1 [label="Maybe b"]
   b1 -> c1 [color=red label="natural\ntrans"]
  }
  a -> b [color=green label="ListF"]
  a -> c [color=green label="MaybeF" ]

  a1 -> b1 [color=green label="ListF"]
  a1 -> c1 [color=green label="MaybeF" ]
  b -> b1 [label="ListF(g)"]
  c -> c1 [label="MaybeF(g)"]
}
@enduml
```

## Naturality square

```plantuml
@startuml
digraph foo {

rankdir=LR
  
  
  subgraph clustera{
   b [label="List a"]
   c [label="Maybe a"]
   b -> c [color=red label="natural\ntrans"]
  }
  subgraph clusterb{
   b1 [label="List b"]
   c1 [label="Maybe b"]
   b1 -> c1 [color=red label="natural\ntrans"]
  }

  b -> b1 [label="ListF(g)"]
  c -> c1 [label="MaybeF(g)"]
}
@enduml
```

# Algebras

3 equivalent ways to define an algebra

$$(\mathbb{N},0::\top \rightarrow \mathbb{N},(+)::\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N})$$
$$(\mathbb{N},in::\top + \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}) \tag{fuse + and 0}$$
$$let\ F X = \top + X \times X \qquad (\mathbb{N}, in::F\ \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N})\tag{package into functor}$$

Other examples of an algebra

* $(\mathbb{B},true::\top \rightarrow \mathbb{B},(\equiv)::\mathbb{B}\times\mathbb{B}\rightarrow\mathbb{B})$
* $(\mathbb{B},false::\top \rightarrow \mathbb{B},(\lor)::\mathbb{B}\times\mathbb{B}\rightarrow\mathbb{B})$

F Algebras are just a set with operations that return values in that set

Inductive datatypes correspond to initial algebras.  
The homomorphisms are catamorphisms or folds.
