# .profile : on login

`~/.profile`{bash} is used as a fallback  
zsh uses `~/.zprofile`{bash}

bash uses ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login instead of ~/.profile

# .zsh : on new shell

more universal than .zprofile because it runs everytime you open a new terminal.  
The bash version is .bashrc

# PATH

`$HOME`{.bash} is same as `~`{.bash}  

```bash
export PATH = "$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
```
