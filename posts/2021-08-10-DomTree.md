title: Dom Tree and rendering
tags: prog, cloud, frontend
---

1. Dom Tree rendering 
    * Dom tree can be blocked(partial parsing) from rendering by CSS rendering and JS rendering
2. CSSOM(CSS Object model) aka CSS Tree rendering
    * CSS can block JS rendering
3. JS script tags will block the DOM tree from rendering
    * This is why JS that modifies DOM elements must be placed in the footer
    * Async can also prevent JS from blocking DOM tree parsing
4. Render tree = DOM + CSSOM
5. Layout, Render tree will check the `<meta viewport=...>` tag and device screen to determine pixel size
6. Painting

# Loading libraries and scripts

* The code below wait until the DOM and JS libraries are loaded

```js
<script async src="somelibrary.js"/>  

<script async>
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    // your code here
})
</script>
```

* `<script defer>` ONLY WAITS FOR DOM PARSED
