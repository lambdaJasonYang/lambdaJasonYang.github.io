1. Normed Space are vector Spaces with a distance function
2. Banach Space are special Normed Space which Cauchy Sequences converge

# function space

* $C[a,b]$ is the set of all functions from a to b is a linear operator.
* $C^1[a,b]$ is the continuous function space

$$C^1[a,b] \subset C[a,b]$$

The continuous function space is also a subspace meaning it is closed under linear operations.

Vectors have a 0 vector so what is the equivalent for functions?

## Zero function

**Zero function maps all values to 0**

# Sequence Space


All Sequences that are Eventually 0 $\subset$ All Sequences that Converge to 0 $\subset$ All Sequences that Converge $
