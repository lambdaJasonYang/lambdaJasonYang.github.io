<p>In the early 2000s, the sound of Javascript induced a visible gag among most programmers in online forums.</p>
<pre><code>[] == ![];</code></pre>
<p>But today with the introduction of Chrome V8 Engine, NodeJS, Typescript, Angular, React the same language would be met with a begrudging acceptance.</p>
<p>Javascript is not going away. Why?</p>
<p>Because it doesnâ€™t need to. Browsers are optimized for Javascript. As a language, Javascript has adapted to become relatively safer with a type system(Typescript). Even as a backend language Javascript has gained popularity(NodeJS Express).</p>
<p>Speaking of backend, there is another revolutionary technology that has made its mark on the 21st century.</p>
<p>The Cloud.</p>
<p>We are now in the age of containers, microservices and serverless functions. There are 3 main cloud providers, Amazon Web Services(AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine. Since my main background knowledge is in AWS, I will refer to AWS when speaking about the cloud.</p>
<p>As Amazon continues to introduce more modular generalizeable lambdas without cold starts, we may even begin to see the decline of backend technologies like Java Spring or C# ASP.NET. Additionally scripting languages like javascript or python are the preferred choice for serverless function as opposed to Java and C# due to their need to compile to byte code then startup a Virtual Machine to run it.</p>
<p>This post would not be complete without an excerpt on AI and Machine Learning. Python is the language of modern data science; there are research grade packages like scikit-learn, tensorflow, pytorch, etc.</p>
<p>Simply put, if I had to bet on languages that will continue to grow in the future, I would bet on Javascript, Python and NoSQL/SQL. You can build a fully scalable full stack application with familarity of the three aforementioned languages on Amazon Web Services. You heard it here folks, the future will be the JPD stack with D standing for DynamoDB.</p>
