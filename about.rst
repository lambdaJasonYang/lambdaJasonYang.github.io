title: Who Am I?
---
| Jason Yang
| Software Engineer
| Experienced in AWS Serverless Cloud technology 
| 
| The reason for this blog isn't to gain popularity or followers but to retain my knowledge.
| I've switch between many frameworks, languages and concepts but after a while, I start to forget what I've done. 
| It really feels like a waste to look back at my projects and not even recognize the pitfalls I had to overcome that may have taken days or weeks to solve.
|
| My blog will mostly include my interests in hardware projects, small scripts, development environment setup and even algorithmic and mathematical proofs.
| The Hakyll powered blog will host mostly conceptual thoughts rather than projects.
| 
| My react-powered project page will be up soon when I have the time.
