| My Hakyll blog will mostly include math, algorithms and small code snippets.
| The main function for this blog is for taking notes so I apologize if many terms are unconventional and explanations are sparse. 
|
| My interests include functional programming, software verification, mathematical modeling and ML.
| I like to tinker with hardware and use open source firmware to get the most out of my devices.
