title: About Me
---
| Jason Yang
| Software Engineer
| Experienced in AWS Serverless Cloud technology 
| 
| The reason for creating blog isn't to gain popularity or followers but to help organize my thoughts. 
|
| My blog will mostly include my interests in hardware projects, small scripts, development environment setup and even algorithmic/mathematical proofs.
| 
| As developers, we believe in separation of concerns and this blog host the more abstract and conceptual components of my learning experiences.
| I host many private gitbooks for learning codebases and new languages.
| My react-powered project page will be up soon when I have the time.
